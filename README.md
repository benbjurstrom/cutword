# CutWord – Edit While You Shoot

Welcome to the CutWord community! 👋

## What is CutWord?

CutWord is a Mac app that transforms how you edit video. Simply speak commands like "new take" or "save take" while recording, and CutWord automatically creates a rough cut of your best moments. 

**Key Features:**
- 🎬 **Real-time preview** of your edits with an integrated video player
- ✂️ **Frame-accurate editing** with precision IN/OUT point control
- 🎯 **Smart segment navigation** – jump to any take instantly
- 📤 **Flexible export options** – to Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, or as video files
- 🔒 **100% private** – everything runs locally on your Mac
